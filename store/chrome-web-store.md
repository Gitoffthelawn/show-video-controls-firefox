# Chrome Web Store listing

> **Not in use for now.** The current plan is to publish on Edge Add-ons only (see
> [edge-addons.md](edge-addons.md)). This file is kept ready in case the extension is
> published on the Chrome Web Store later, which requires a one-time developer fee.

Package: build with `node scripts/build-chromium.mjs`, then zip the **contents** of
`dist/chromium/` (the release workflow also attaches this zip to every GitHub release).
The same package is used for Edge. See [edge-addons.md](edge-addons.md).

The listing is edited in the [Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole).
Fields marked *(from manifest)* are filled in automatically from `_locales/`.

## Privacy tab

The text fields in this tab are reviewed by Google staff, so they are in English only.

**Single purpose**

> Automatically turns on the browser's built-in playback controls for HTML5 video elements on the websites the user allows.

**Permission justifications**

| Permission | Justification |
| --- | --- |
| `storage` | Saves the user's choices locally: the mode (all sites except a list, or only a list), the two site lists, the optional "Block autoplay" switch, the interface language and the theme. Nothing is synced or sent anywhere. |
| `activeTab` | When the user opens the popup, reads the address of the current tab only to prefill the "Site domain" field, so a site can be added to the list in one click. It is not used in the background. |
| Content script on all sites (`<all_urls>` match in `content_scripts`) | The extension has to find `<video>` elements on whichever page the user visits in order to turn on their controls. The script only reads the page's host name, the user's saved site lists and `<video>` elements. Only if the user turns on the optional "Block autoplay" switch (off by default), it also listens for a video starting to play and pauses it when no click, tap or key press caused it. It collects, stores and transmits no page content. It is already inactive on the sites the user excludes and on the video services excluded in the manifest. |

**Remote code**: No. All code is in the package, and there is no `eval` or remotely hosted script.

**Data usage**: select none of the data types. Check all three certifications (no sale of data, no use unrelated to the single purpose, no use for creditworthiness or lending).

## Test instructions (Distribution tab)

No account or login is needed. To see the extension work:

1. Open https://example.com and the browser's developer console.
2. Paste the line below. It adds a video **without** controls. The extension turns them on right away.

```js
document.body.append(Object.assign(document.createElement('video'), { src: 'https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.webm', width: 480 }))
```

3. Click the toolbar icon. The domain `example.com` is already filled in. Select **Add site**. The controls disappear from the open page, because the site is now excluded. Select **Remove** and they come back.

(If the browser blocks pasting, type `allow pasting` in the console first.)
